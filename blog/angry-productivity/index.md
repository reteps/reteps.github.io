Hi. I‚Äôm a CS student @ UIUC. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to stay on top of your stuff. Here is how to become a master productivity-er even when you are as lazy as me.### Technology I use

*   Apple M1 Laptop. Awesome battery life. iMessage. Clean UI. Get the pro if you are rich AF. Get the [long extension cable](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK122LL/A/power-adapter-extension-cable). The fucking block sucks.
*   Windows Desktop. Gaming + Game Development + Virtual Machines, you want to be on Windows for any beefy computational work. Second monitor. 2 monitors = 200% productive.
*   Mechanical Keyboard. I annoy the shit out of my roommate. You can too.

### My workflow

Use Google Calendar. It‚Äôs good.

Stop forgetting assignments. Use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/). It has a google calendar integration and natural language processing for setting reminders. You can say ‚Äúmath hw due every Tuesday, and Thursday at 11:59pm‚Äù. Boom, bi-weekly reminders popup on your google calendar + notifications. Customize notifications using google calendar time from the event.

Stop using the notes app. Use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Take notes easily, draw sketches easily. Mobile/Laptop/Desktop sync. Notion without the complexity.

Stop using Chrome. [Brave](https://brave.com/)has a built-in ad blocker. Built-in dark mode. I don‚Äôt want bad vision.

Use VSCode. Don‚Äôt spend hours customizing your neovim instance just to turn it into a shitty VSCode. You are not a 10x developer.

These tools suck. Make them better.

#### Improving Brave

*   Stop using Chrome autofill. Get [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/). A free password manager with sync, and simple autofill.
*   Block literally every ad. Get [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en).
*   Stop writing shitty essays. Get [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-grammar-checker/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen/related). Get an A.
*   Stop pulling out your phone for 2FA. Get [Authenticator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/authenticator/bhghoamapcdpbohphigoooaddinpkbai?hl=en).
*   Wikipedia looks like shit. [Wikiwand] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wikiwand-wikipedia-modern/emffkefkbkpkgpdeeooapgaicgmcbolj?hl=en-US)makes it less shit.
*   Get inspired. I use [momentum] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en)for my new tab page.
*   Organize your shit. Use just the icons for sites. Use folders for class bookmarks.

*   Stop having 3000 tabs. Use tab groups for each class.

#### Improving Obsidian

*   Fuck it. Get the Sync. Worth paying 5$/month instead of using version control for syncing your notes or learning an overcomplicated overengineered thing like Notion.
*   Get Excalidraw Plugin. Embed clean AF drawings right into your notes.

Caption: Latex. Easy Markdown syntax. Easy drawing built in.



#### Improve VSCode

Stop looking over their shoulder for pair programming. Use VSCode [live share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share). Google docs for code.

Write good code. Use Prettier. Use PyLance. Use Intellisense. Write Latex with VSCode.

Use GitHub [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). Get the [Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) if you haven‚Äôt already. It was trained on your code to write code faster than you.

#### Improving your Mac

*   Be knowledgable. Show your actual battery stats. Show your CPU/Ram usage. Get [stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats).
*   Stop opening Google Calendar. Get [Itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/).
*   Play Spotify on computer speakers at 50% volume, but a lecture on headphones at 30% volume. Get [SoundSource](https://rogueamoeba.com/soundsource/). üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èDon‚Äôt pay for it.üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
*   Stop trying to perfectly line up two windows in a split screen. Get [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/).
*   Stop using the little pencil in preview mode to edit your pictures. Get [FlameShot](https://flameshot.org/). Edit screenshots easily.
*   Stop losing your copy-paste (and your mind). Get [CopyClip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copyclip-clipboard-history/id595191960?mt=12). It saves your clipboard history.

#### Improving Mac Development

*   Stop clicking on download links. Use [brew] (https://brew.sh/)to install terminal apps and GUI apps.
*   Use [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/). The default terminal sucks. Make it better. Use zsh. Bash is an ancient shell. Get [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for the plugins. Then get a [git version control plugin.](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh) Boom, no more git status checks.
*   Need Windows? Need Linux? Use [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/). üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è[PD-Runner](https://github.com/utsanjan/PD-Runner)üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è. Runs natively on ARM with the hypervisor. It‚Äôs fast.
*   Dependency Hell for your project? Stop. Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). It‚Äôs 2022.

#### Improving Windows

Ascend into ultra CS Major. [Wallpaper Engine](https://www.wallpaperengine.io/en).

Flameshot. Docker. oh-my-zsh. Duh.

[WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) + [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&amp;gl=us). Fuck Powershell. Fuck the command prompt. Don‚Äôt pore over the details of the distro, just use Ubuntu LTS. It‚Äôs simple. It works. I don‚Äôt need to squeeze an extra 10% perf out of my distro, and neither should you. Forward your Ubuntu GUI Apps with [VcXsrv](https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/).

### Conclusion

I don‚Äôt hate you, just your workflow. Be efficient. Go party. Watch that Netflix series. Stop doing work.
